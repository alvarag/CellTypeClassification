Our group utilize Deep Learning algorithms to classify different cell types or cells from different stages of cell differentitation, simply based on small-sized brightfield cell images acquired from everyday use benchtop microscope. Please refer to [bioRxiv] for detailed introduction of the project.

This repository contains codes for several parts for the proposed cell type / cell morphology classification pipeline, all files are able to be compiled under MATLAB 2017b/2018a/2018b (MathWorks Inc.):

I. Preparation
1. Cell Cropping

2. Cell Normalization

3. Cell Augmentation 

II. Training
1. Neural Network Training

III. Application
1. Cell Type Classification
