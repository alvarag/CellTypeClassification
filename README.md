We utilize deep learning algorithms to classify different cell types or different stages of cell differentitation, simply based on cell images acquired from everyday use benchtop microscope. Please refer to [bioRxiv] for detailed introduction of the project.

This repository contains several files for the proposed cell type classification pipeline:

1. Cell Cropping

2. Cell Normalization

3. Neural Network Training

4. Cell Type Classification
